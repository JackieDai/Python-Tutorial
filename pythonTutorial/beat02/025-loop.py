# There are two primitive loop types for Python: while and for.

# A for loop is used for iterating over a seqence

# this is less like the for keyword in other programing languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programing language.

for x in range(4):
    print(x)

print("-----")
for x in range(2,10,2):
    print(x)
