# List are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

# List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.


## Ordered 

# when we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

# If you add new items to list, the new items will be placed at the end of list


## List Constructor

# It is also possible to use the list() constructor when creatning a new list

list = list(("allle",123))
print(list)
print(type(list))


## NOTE Python Collections

# There are four collection data types in the Python programing language:
    # List      ordered     changeable      duplicate
    # Tuple     ordered     unchangeable    duplicate
    # Set       unOrdered   unchangeable    unduplicate
    # Dictonary
